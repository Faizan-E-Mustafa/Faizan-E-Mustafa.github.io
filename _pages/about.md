I apply Natural Language Processing techniques to extract useful information from unstructured data. My CV can be accessed [here.](https://Faizan-E-Mustafa.github.io/pdfs/CV.pdf)

My current project at [QUIBIQ GmbH](https://www.quibiq.de/), namely [AI4MedCode](https://www.ki.uni-stuttgart.de/departments/ac/research/projects/AI4MedCode/), involves developing models that assist hospital staff in ICD coding to improve the billing process. We have created **Biomedical Named Entity Recognition** and **Entity Linking models** for German, which can be extended to other **low-resource languages**. 

My previous works involved implementation of **Graph Neural Network** for the prediction of diseases using medical procedures. Moreover, we have used Graph Neural Network in the link prediction setting to annotate PubMed Abstracts with MeSH Headings. Please refer to the [publications](https://faizan-e-mustafa.github.io/publications/) for detailed information about the work.
