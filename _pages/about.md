I am a student of MSc Computational Linguistics at University of Stuttgart. I am interested in applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Natural Languages. 

Have a look at my [***resume***](https://Faizan-E-Mustafa.github.io/images/CV.pdf) for more information.

I like to play cricket but trying my luck with badminton these days :-)
