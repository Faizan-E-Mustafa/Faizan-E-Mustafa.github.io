This seminar `Statistical Dependency Parsing(Winter 2020)` was taught at University of Stuttgart by [Dr. Agnieszka Fale≈Ñska](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Falenska/) and [Mr. Xiang Yu](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Yu-00010/). This post contains material produced during this seminar.

## Dependency Parser Project: 

Following parsers were implemented from scratch .
* Graph based: Eisner
* Transition based: Arc-standard  (Not Complete yet)

if you want to know more about the project you can read more about it [here](https://Faizan-E-Mustafa.github.io/pdfs/SDP/SDP_Report.pdf). The repository containing the code can be accessed using [this link](https://github.com/Faizan-E-Mustafa/Dependency-Parsing).

## Paper Summaries:

We had to summaries atleast two papers.

| Paper        | Link         | Summary  |

| Frustratingly Easy Cross-Lingual Transfer for Transition-Based Dependency Parsing    | [link](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1121.pdf) | [link](https://Faizan-E-Mustafa.github.io/pdfs/SDP/SDP_Summary2.pdf) |

## Presentation:

I presented a paper named [Graph-based Dependency Parsing with Graph Neural Networks](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1237/). The presentation can be downloaded from [here.](https://Faizan-E-Mustafa.github.io/pdfs/SDP/SDP_Presentation.pptx)
